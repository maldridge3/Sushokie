# Sushokie

Sushokie is a project I made to showcase some of my softer data skills. I manually collected pricing data for popular sushi rolls from every sushi restaurant in the OKC area, stored these data in a PostgreSQL database, synced this database to Tableau, and then created an interactive table. I then posted this table to a corresponding website. I added the website url and password here. Additionally, the data I collected are available here as well as an ERD for the PostgreSQL database in which I stored them, for those interested.

Note: Occassionally, the website is not accessible. If this is the case, you can view the table displaying the pricing data on Tableau public via this link: https://public.tableau.com/views/Sushokie_dashboard/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link.
